# Backup Manager 3
Yet another continuation on my backup programs! However, this one is a lot prettier and simpler to work with.
You can select what folders it should backup, and on what weekdays. It is a one way backup system that only replaces files in the backup folder, if a newer one is avilable from the source folder.
